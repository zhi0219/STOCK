# Judge set configuration for PR11 (SIM-only, deterministic)

# Each window represents a holdout slice of Data/quotes.csv that must never be
# used for training. Windows can be defined by (start_row, count) to avoid
# time-zone drift and remain deterministic.

windows:
  - name: "early_slice"
    start_row: 1
    count: 200
  - name: "mid_slice"
    start_row: 500
    count: 200
  - name: "late_slice"
    start_row: 1000
